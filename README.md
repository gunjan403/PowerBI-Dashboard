## Process:
-Identify data sources (Excel, SQL Server, etc.)

-Clean and transform data using Power Query (remove duplicates, handle missing values).

-Made sure data is consistent and standardized with respect to data types, data formats and values used.

-Optimize using DAX measures and calculated columns.

-Choose the right visualizations (e.g., bar chart, pie charts, maps, matrix, cards
